# Vulnerability-Analysis-Enhancement-of-KNN-Algorithm
This repository documents a university project undertaken by a group of three individuals. The project's objective was to identify vulnerabilities within an existing classification algorithm of our choice and subsequently enhance it to address the identified vulnerabilities.

The chosen algorithm for this project was K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Two vulnerabilities were identified: outliers and overfitting. The team addressed these vulnerabilities through two approaches: hyperparameter tuning (utilizing different distance metrics) and the implementation of bagging (bootstrap aggregating), respectively.

## Notebooks
- Datasets.ipynb: This notebook contains the exploration of various datasets imported from OpenML. This exploration was crucial for selecting the dataset with the most outliers.

- Machine_Learning.ipynb: This notebook comprises the project's development, including the creation of the team's models. It's noteworthy that no data preprocessing was conducted for this project, as per the project's requirements.
